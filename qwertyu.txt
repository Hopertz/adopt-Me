Main Objective

The general objective of this study is to improve the performance of deep learning models 
of speech synthesis for the Swahili Language.

Specific objectives
i)	To establish the MOS of the existing speech synthesis deep learning models for the Low resource languages from literature. 
ii)	To determine parameters needed for better performance of speech synthesis models for the Swahili Language.
iii)	To evaluate the MOS of the proposed model and compare it against existing models.


Research Questions

i)	What is the MOS of the existing speech synthesis deep learning models for the Low resource languages from literature? 
ii)	How can the existing models be fine-tuned in order to improve the MOS of the speech synthesis for the Swahili language? 
iii)	How is the MOS of the proposed model in comparison with existing models?


Significance of the study
This study will come up with a model that has improved perfomance in the speech synthesis of swahili language.
Inform future research and will also help in the building industrial

Speech synthesis has a variety of techniques/technologies involved such as 
Formant synthesis which is based on the source-filter model. It uses vocal 
tract modeling. Concatenative synthesis with unit selection, the process of 
stitching small units of pre-recorded waveforms together was state-of-the-art 
for many years. Statistical parametric speech synthesis 
which directly generates smooth trajectories of speech features to be synthesized 
by a vocoder, followed, solving many of the issues that concatenative synthesis 
had with boundary artifacts Deep learning-based synthesis is 
the current state of the art and achieved great improvements.
